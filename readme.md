- connect to PC
- Drive should appear
- Copy files over 
- CIRCUITPY drive should now appear with a code.py file 
- Modify code.py file

# Serial Terminal
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/connecting-to-the-serial-console 

I used PuTTY on Windows + VS code to access the serial port, but you can use the "Mu" editor it recommends for an all in 1 IDE (lame)
> Device manager, Find COM port its connected on (This i don't know how to do on MAC)
> Find correct port, set speed (115200) and connect
